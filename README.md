  * reversing teammanager (in Ghidra)
  * found use-after-free and created poc in python

  * working setup for heap analysis would be good (e.g., `gef's heap (chunk|chunks|bins|arenas)` commands)
  * next time:
    * finish teammanager exploit
    * [cyanpencil](https://github.com/cyanpencil) will bring another heap challenge
